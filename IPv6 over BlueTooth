Before we can connect to it, we need to load and enable the bluetooth_6lowpan kernel module:

$ sudo modprobe bluetooth_6lowpan 
$ sudo bash -c 'echo 1 > /sys/kernel/debug/bluetooth/6lowpan_enable' 

Now, we can make a connection by executing the following command (replace 00:AA:BB:CC:DD:EE with the actual address of your device):

$ sudo bash -c 'echo "connect 00:AA:BB:CC:DD:EE 1" > /sys/kernel/debug/bluetooth/6lowpan_control'
(Note that we can't just sudo echo "...." > .... , because in this case the redirection won't be covered by sudo )

(When LED2 Turns on, your device is connected)

We can ping it by the link-local address of the following form:

$ ping6 fe80::2aa:bbff:fecc:ddee%bt0

Again, replace aa , bb, cc , dd , ee with the address of your device. If that works, then we can finally access our HTTP endpoint on the 
device

$ curl http://[fe80::2aa:bbff:fecc:ddee%bt0]/foo/bar 
<h1>Hello, sir!</h1> 
You asked for /foo/bar
